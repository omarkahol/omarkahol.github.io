My master thesis focused on the experimental multiparameter optimization of atmospheric ionic thrusters, which are a promising alternative to traditional propulsive units. These thrusters utilize two electrodes, with one being a small wire and the other an aerodynamic shape, to create a strong electric field that ionizes the air surrounding them. The resulting plasma is propelled by the electric field towards the airfoil, or collector, which generates thrust by transferring kinetic energy to the surrounding air. Ionic thrusters are environmentally friendly, electric, and contain no moving parts, making them an attractive option for propulsion systems.

Despite successful demonstrations of this technology in recent years (the most notable one being an airplane developed at MIT), there is still much to be understood about its behaviour, particularly in relation to the influence of geometrical parameters such as electrode distance and airfoil shape. Additionally, a lack of a proper dimensionless model makes it difficult to understand how these parameters interact with one another.
To address these issues, the thesis employed a mathematical analysis of electro-hydrodynamics equations under non-thermal equilibrium discharges. A dimensionless formulation was then used to extract reference quantities and dimensionless numbers for geometric, electric, and aerodynamic parameters. A one-dimensional model was then developed to further investigate the behaviour of these quantities.


An extensive experimental campaign was conducted to study different geometries and airfoil shapes under varying voltages to extract dimensionless numbers and their functional relationships with respect to dimensionless parameters. A novel experimental setup was design and realized. This setup can host collectors of different shapes and sizes. It can also adjust several geometric parameters allowing for a multi-parameteric experimental investigation. Experimental measurement techniques were employed to measure the high voltages and discharge currents and the aerodynamic forces created by the thruster.
The results of the optimization and experimental investigation are promising, as they provide dimensionless methods and optimized geometries for atmospheric ionic thrusters. Overall, this thesis contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of atmospheric ionic thrusters and provides valuable insights for their further development and implementation in practical applications.
