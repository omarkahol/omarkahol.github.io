A damper is a device that suppresses vibrations and dissipates their energy in the form of heat. The aim of the REGIM project is to bring an innovative regenerative damper into the agricultural sector. Regenerative dampers recover the kinetic energy of the vibrations and convert it into readily usable electric energy.

REGIM is part of a bigger initiative driven by Frandent Group, an Italian company specialized in the production of agricultural machines. Frandent promotes the continuous improvement of its machines through equipment that requires lower energy consumption and increases productivity. REGIM aims to design a regenerative damper that could substitute the conventional ones already installed on the agricultural machines, bringing the added benefit of energy recovery, thus increasing fuel efficiency.

The project involves the optimization of the device with regards to several physical phenomena (multiphysics) and the design of the electrical circuit to interface the device with a battery (power electronics).

The integration of a regenerative damper on agricultural machinery supports the innovation wave of sustainable mechanization and electrification. In this regard, the project acts towards the global effort of the Sustainable Development Goals by fostering the Goals of Zero Hunger (2), Affordable and Clean Energy (7) and Responsible Consumption and Production (12).
