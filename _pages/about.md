I graduated in Aeronautical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano with a specialization in aerodynamics and having completed an experimental thesis on ionic thrusters. 
Additionally, I took part in the XVII cycle <a href='https://asp-poli.it'>Alta Scuola Politecnica</a> which is a multisciplinary double degree that completes the master track with horizontal skills such as innovation management, decision making and communication. During these two years, I was part of the REGIM project which aimed at designing and testing an electromagnetic shock absorber with power regeneration capabilities.

I am currently working at INRIA as a double PhD student affiliated with the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions doctoral network <a href='https://traces-project.eu'>TRACES</a>. This is a project that aims at providing high-level training in the field of in-flight icing, a complex multidisciplinary field. My research project will lean more on the mathematical side as it aims to provide a robust procedure to quantify the model error for ice accretion models using state-of-the-art Uncertainty Quantification techniques.
